# REPO WITH AZURE PIPELINES
It is a little bit outdated, as I changed some scripts only here in GitHub, but all  of pipelines works fine and were untouched.

Scripts in the Azure and GitHub repositories  differ a bit as they have been changed in order to run  the pipelines. GitHub Actions runs Azure CLI scripts while Azure DevOps runs Powershell scripts.
